# Planets Explorer
It represents the testing brief of the imaginary application called Planets Explorer. You have woken up at an unknown planet. Everywhere you look you see only desert. You have some supplies in your ship, but the engines are gone. You must quickly identify where you are and try to call for help. You have access to the very old API: https://swapi.py4e.com/ with the basic data of all the planets in the known universe. In the ship, only old computer from the previous millennia, with old school so-called "Internet" technology is working.
